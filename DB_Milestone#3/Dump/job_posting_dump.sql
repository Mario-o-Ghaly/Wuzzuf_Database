Leave nothing to chance  Even the smallest misconfigurations can have a profound impact on today’s powerful yet fragile networks. Always validate proposed changes to determine the impact before making them. Document everything  Much like a personal medical history, thorough documentation of changes and updates is the best way to ensure good network health. Making a note of it today can eliminate a big headache tomorrow. Never stop learning  The better you understand your network, the quicker you can diagnose a problem and have things up and running again. There is always room for knowledge. Automate wherever possible  Mundane tasks take up more time than you realize. If you can eliminate the simplest of daily tasks, you will have more room for making improvements. Overcommunicate  When it comes to the health and stability of your network, there is no such thing as overcommunicating. Make sure that everyone has access to information needed to troubleshoot and perform repairs if needed. Establish a single source of truth  Networks are complex. Ensuring that everyone involved is looking at the same data and information is critical to ensuring faster recovery teams and eliminating potentially damaging mistakes.
