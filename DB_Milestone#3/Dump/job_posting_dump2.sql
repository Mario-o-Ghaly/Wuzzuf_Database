Typically, these tasks are a small part of a real project that you will work on with the guidance and supervision of a mentor. We expect a commitment to quality from every team member. New colleagues need to dedicate themselves to learning how to produce high-quality work. As you gain more independence in your coding skills, tackle more complex tasks, and assist others, you will increase your capability to become a full-stack Software Engineer. What do we expect from a Junior Developer?The title says it all - we expect you to be a true Junior, with a hunger for information and advice from mentors and senior colleagues. You will learn by doing, each iteration and learning experience bringing you closer to a solid foundation and success. However, to join successfully, a basic understanding and skill set in PHP, CSS, and My SQL is mandatory. You may have acquired this knowledge through your university studies, late-night tutorial sessions on You Tube, or by exploring code on your own. Occasionally, you will also be involved in quality assurance testing for the projects you are entrusted with maintaining. While prior work experience is not expected, starting knowledge is required. Over time, every developer becomes full-stack capable. While most of our projects are based on Magento and PWA, there are exceptions involving Shopify, Laravel, or other platforms. Be prepared to develop a well-rounded skill set in e Commerce development!Please note that if you are joining scandiweb remotely, you will need to have your own hardware setup. After the probation period, it is possible to arrange a hardware upgrade. You must have: Ubuntu (Linux) operating system for work. If you want to keep Windows, install Ubuntu alongside it (dual boot) instead of using Virtualbox, WSL, or any other method. It is recommended to have a CPU i5 or AMD equivalent, SSD with 512GB, and 16GB of RAM. How to apply?Complete the necessary details, and we will promptly get back to you with the next steps. The next steps typically involve a test assignment and a technical interview. To successfully pass the test, a basic understanding of web applications developed using PHP, My SQL, HTML, and CSS will be needed. While your education course will cover topics like React, Graph QL, and deployment to cloud environments based on Kubernetes, initially you are required to possess only the fundamentals of web development.

As a member of CGIAR, World Fish contributes to building a food- and nutrition-secure future and restoring natural resources. Headquartered in Penang, Malaysia, with country offices across Africa, Asia, and the Pacific, World Fish strives to create resilient and inclusive food systems for shared prosperity. For more information, visit: www.worldfishcenter.org” Background of the Project In June 2023, World Fish has partnered with the Royal Norwegian Embassy in Cairo to initiate Center for Renewable Energy in Aquaculture (Ce REA) project. A 4-year groundbreaking initiative to refine, test, and scale innovative renewable energy solutions that enable 5,000 fish producers, processors, and other fish value chain actors in Egypt to increase their productivity and incomes, leading to improved food and nutrition security, reduced food waste and loss, and more energy-efficient and climate-smart food value chains. Center for Renewable Energy in Aquaculture (Ce REA) key interventions seek to: Refine, test, and scale innovative renewable energy solutions that enable fish value chain actors in Egypt to increase their productivity and income leading to improved food and nutrition security, reduced food waste and loss, and more adaptation to energy-efficient and climate-smart systems. Deployment of appropriate renewable energy technologies for aquaculture, along with efficient planning ad capacity building for scaling the Egyptian aquaculture sector in a sustainable, climate-friendly and inclusive manner to support both economic growth and protein needs of the country’s rapidly expanding population. Consultancy objectives: Development of a gender-sensitive assessment tool which has to consider intersectionality through integrating socio-economic inclusion across multiple dimensions of the Egyptian aquaculture value chain Identify critical factors that limit women and youth participation, engagement and highlighting viable pathways to ensure that (Ce REA)’s selected innovations for piloting and scaling are strongly integrating gender and social inclusion across different project outputs. Identify opportunities for women and youth empowerment along the Egyptian aquaculture value chain, with considerations to climate-change constrains. Design of a gender-sensitive and inclusive strategy for (Ce REA)’s 4-years strategic implementation. Scope of Consultancy: World Fish seeks to hire a gender and social inclusion international consultant. S/he is to join another two consultants in designing and developing a baseline study that shall addresses solutions for optimizing renewable energy solutions aimed at tackling key challenges within Egyptian aquaculture value chain. The mentioned-study requires development of key instrumental surveying tools that mainly focus on: Carrying out a gender assessment for analyzing gender and social inclusion gaps, challenges and opportunities using (Micro, Meso and Macro) analyses among other tools (e.g. S. W. O. T analysis). Integrating gender and youth specific approaches to enhance social inclusion dimensions for increasing their participation in (Ce REA)’s different activities (e.g. entrepreneurship opportunities for women processors, fish retailers and small-scale farmers). Piloting at least two or three gender transformative approaches (GTAs) in the research cites to determine the best GTA approach that can be scaled to advance the work of promoting the use of climate-smart and renewable energy in the Ce REA project. Submission of a preliminary report of key-findings and results that have been carried out under the baseline survey of the study for the gender equality and social inclusion domain of the project. Development of (GESI) strategy, gender-sensitive assessment tool that will be mainstreamed across the project key interventions until 2027 and submission of consultancy final technical report.
