# Wuzzuf_Database
## Overview
This is a project developed individually by the author during Fall 2023 semester using using **MySQL** as the relational database management system, **db4free.net** for migrating data, **Python** for web scrapping and for the user application, and Jupyter Notebook for interactive development with the web crawler.

## Description
Description and details of tbe project is attached as a powerpoint in the main page. The main page also has a link to my demo.

The folders divided into the following:
- *Code + Excutable*, which has the final user application together with the .py file for the code. This was done in milestone3 of the project, so you would find the same folder in milestone 3. I just added it to the main page for simplicity. 
- **DB_Milestone#1**, which has the database ER & ERD and the SQL statements for creating the tables.
- **DB_Milestone#2**, which has the crawling/scrapping script, MySQL dump file for the data, and the CSV values deduced from the web scrapping.
- **DB_Milestone#3**, which has the application code, the excutable file and the demo link along with the dump files divided according to the table for migrating the data to db4free.
  

## User Guide
You can download the excutable file from the *Code + Excutable* folder directly and run the application. In case it doesnot work because I used db4free.net for free -- my account might be suspended anytime -- I have attached a link to a video showing each query and how it works.
