Join us and become part of our ambitious journey!","What is a day like for a Junior Developer?The first day and the following few weeks you will dedicate to onboarding, where you will learn about the tools we use, the processes we follow, the company's history, and its culture. You will set up your workspace and workstation, equipping them with the necessary apps. Once that is completed, you will be assigned education tasks, which involve applying the tools you have learned. Typically, these tasks are a small part of a real project that you will work on with the guidance and supervision of a mentor. We expect a commitment to quality from every team member. New colleagues need to dedicate themselves to learning how to produce high-quality work. As you gain more independence in your coding skills, tackle more complex tasks, and assist others, you will increase your capability to become a full-stack Software Engineer. What do we expect from a Junior Developer?The title says it all - we expect you to be a true Junior, with a hunger for information and advice from mentors and senior colleagues. You will learn by doing, each iteration and learning experience bringing you closer to a solid foundation and success. However, to join successfully, a basic understanding and skill set in PHP, CSS, and My SQL is mandatory. You may have acquired this knowledge through your university studies, late-night tutorial sessions on You Tube, or by exploring code on your own. Occasionally, you will also be involved in quality assurance testing for the projects you are entrusted with maintaining. While prior work experience is not expected, starting knowledge is required. Over time, every developer becomes full-stack capable. While most of our projects are based on Magento and PWA, there are exceptions involving Shopify, Laravel, or other platforms. Be prepared to develop a well-rounded skill set in e Commerce development!Please note that if you are joining scandiweb remotely, you will need to have your own hardware setup. After the probation period, it is possible to arrange a hardware upgrade. You must have: Ubuntu (Linux) operating system for work.

It is recommended to have a CPU i5 or AMD equivalent, SSD with 512GB, and 16GB of RAM. How to apply?Complete the necessary details, and we will promptly get back to you with the next steps. The next steps typically involve a test assignment and a technical interview. To successfully pass the test, a basic understanding of web applications developed using PHP, My SQL, HTML, and CSS will be needed.

CCNA is a must, CCNP is plus Skilled with cloud, scripting, and writing and routing protocols. Fluent in a variety of programs and software. Leave nothing to chance  Even the smallest misconfigurations can have a profound impact on today’s powerful yet fragile networks. Always validate proposed changes to determine the impact before making them. Document everything  Much like a personal medical history, thorough documentation of changes and updates is the best way to ensure good network health. Making a note of it today can eliminate a big headache tomorrow. Never stop learning  The better you understand your network, the quicker you can diagnose a problem and have things up and running again. There is always room for knowledge. Automate wherever possible  Mundane tasks take up more time than you realize. If you can eliminate the simplest of daily tasks, you will have more room for making improvements. Overcommunicate  When it comes to the health and stability of your network, there is no such thing as overcommunicating. Make sure that everyone has access to information needed to troubleshoot and perform repairs if needed. Establish a single source of truth  Networks are complex. Ensuring that everyone involved is looking at the same data and information is critical to ensuring faster recovery teams and eliminating potentially damaging mistakes. Begin with the end in mind  We are lifting this one verbatim from Dr. Covey as it represents a simple but brilliant approach to networking. What are you trying to accomplish as a business? First understand the goals and then work backward to construct a network that makes it a reality. ",2023-09-01,2,0,3,5,Experienced (Non-Manager),,12000,25000,False,,1,Efada Technology,Egypt,Cairo,
